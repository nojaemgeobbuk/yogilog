# Yogilog (요기로그) - Project Overview

## Purpose
Yogilog is a yoga session tracker mobile app with a unique "music player aesthetic" design. The app allows users to:
- Track yoga sessions with details like duration, intensity, and poses (asanas)
- View session history via a calendar interface
- Browse an asana library (presented as "Top Artists" in the music player metaphor)
- Add photos and notes to sessions
- Share session summaries as images

## Design Philosophy
The app uses a "kitschy" music player aesthetic where:
- Sessions are displayed like album covers/playlists
- The home screen features a "Now Playing" carousel of sessions
- The asana library is presented as "Top Artists"
- Session details look like "Now Playing" screens

## Target Platform
- Mobile (iOS/Android) via React Native + Expo
- Web support available
